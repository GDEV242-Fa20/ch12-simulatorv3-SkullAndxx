A predator-prey simulation involving foxes, wolves and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

This is the second version of the simulation.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
        
Observe the introduction of the Alpha Wolf. The wolf eats both rabbits and foxes. 
It begins with the least population and slowly grows to overtake the foxes in their habitat.
